# Forging-Magnetism

### Summary
----------
Project to find how different variables affect the final hardness of metal after quenching.

### Description
---------------
This repository details a Jupyter notebook that contains code to analyze the curie point for multiple metals, to compare what the temperature is that each metal must reach to become non-magnetic. This analysis is being done in order to eventually determine the factors that affect the final hardness of the metal after quenching, a process in forging which involves getting the metal above the curie point, making it non-magnetic, and then immediatly quenching the metal.
